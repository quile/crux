# crux
## Routing guided by the constellations

This is a loose port of the excellent Clojure URL-router
[polaris](https://github.com/caribou/polaris), part of the
[Caribou](http://let-caribou.in) ecosystem.

At present it is a very direct port from Clojure, using
[mori](https://github.com/swannodette/mori) to assist with
building and handling immutable data structures.

More docs to come...
